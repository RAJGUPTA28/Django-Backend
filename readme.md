# How does Django Work?
Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template).

- Model - The data you want to present, usually data from a database.
- View - A request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user.
- Template - A text file (like an HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.


- Model
The model provides data from the database.
In Django, the data is delivered as an Object Relational Mapping (ORM), which is a technique designed to make it easier to work with databases.
The most common way to extract data from a database is SQL. One problem with SQL is that you have to have a pretty good understanding of the database structure to be able to work with it.
Django, with ORM, makes it easier to communicate with the database, without having to write complex SQL statements.

The models are usually located in a file called models.py.
